# Revenue v/s Risk Prediction

This project explores the trade-off between **revenue generation** and **risk exposure** in financial decision-making. The goal here is to build a predictive model that quantifies how changes in risk levels affect revenue outcomes, and vice versa. By analyzing historical financial data, the model will help identify the optimal balance & relation between profitability and stability.
